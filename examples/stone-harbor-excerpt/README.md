# Excerpt from Stone Harbor

This is the Prologue from the interactive story, [Stone Harbor](https://stoneharborgame.com), entered
as part of the 2016 [Interactive Fiction Competition](https://ifcomp.org). It has been updated
to use the latest version of the Windrift story framework, and is provided as a
reference.

You're welcome to browse the original [Stone Harbor source](https://github.com/lizadaly/stone-harbor-game)
as well, but the original version is not compatible with the current Windrift
framework. Please use the Windrift [starter project](https://github.com/lizadaly/windrift-starter)
for development of new works.
