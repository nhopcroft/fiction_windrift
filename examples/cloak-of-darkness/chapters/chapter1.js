            Hurrying through the rainswept November night, you’re glad to see the
            bright lights of the Opera House.
          </p>
          <p>It’s surprising that there aren’t more
          people about…</p>

        <h3>Foyer of Opera House</h3>
        <p>
          You are standing in a spacious hall, splendidly decorated in red and gold,
          with glittering chandeliers overhead. The entrance from the street is to
          the <List expansions={["north", "north"]} tag="foyer_north" nextUnit={null} />,

            outside seems to be getting worse. There `
          }} />
          are doorways <List expansions={["south", "south"]} tag="foyer_south" nextUnit={null} /> and <List expansions={["west", "west"]} tag="foyer_west" />.

        <h3>Cloakroom</h3>
        <p>
          The walls of this small room were clearly once lined with hooks, though

          &nbsp;The exit is a <List expansions={["door", "door"]} tag="cloakroom_door" /> to the east.

        <h3>The Bar</h3>
        <p>
          The bar, much rougher than you’d have guessed after the opulence of the
          foyer to the north, is completely empty. There seems to be some sort
          of <List expansions={["scrawled message", "scrawled message"]} tag="message" /> in the sawdust on the floor.
        </p>
        <Map from={inventory.message} to={{
          message: <div id="finale">The message reads:
            <div id="message" className={inventory.bar_north === "around randomly" ? "lost" : "won"}>
